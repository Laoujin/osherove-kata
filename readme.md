TDD Katas
=========
[Roy Osherover](http://osherove.com/) author of [The Art of Unit Testing: with examples in C#](http://www.amazon.com/Art-Unit-Testing-examples/dp/1617290890/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1422582329&sr=1-1&keywords=the+art+of+unit+testing) posted 2 Code Katas to train TDD (or at least UnitTesting:), this is a solution in **Python**.

There is one commit for each exercise # in the Katas.

I had to look up pretty much every command so there might be nicer ways to accomplish some things. 

The `add` function is perhaps a bit long but overal I'm pretty happy with the result :)
